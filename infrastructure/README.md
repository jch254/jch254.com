   1. Run `aws configure` and fill in the details it asks for.
   1. Run on an EC2 instance with an IAM Role.

#### Deploying infrastructure

1. Configure Terraform to use Remote State using the following command:
```terraform remote config -backend=s3 -backend-config="bucket=your-remote-state-bucket" -backend-config="key=jch254.com.tfstate" -backend-config="region=your-region" -backend-config="encrypt=true"```
1. `terraform plan -var-file jch254.com.tfvars`
1. `terraform apply -var-file jch254.com.tfvars`

#### Updating infrastructure

1. Make necessary infrastructure code changes.
1. Configure Terraform to use Remote State using the following command:
```terraform remote config -backend=s3 -backend-config="bucket=your-remote-state-bucket" -backend-config="key=jch254.comtfstate" -backend-config="region=your-region" -backend-config="encrypt=true"```
1. `terraform plan -var-file jch254.com.tfvars`
1. `terraform apply -var-file jch254.com.tfvars`

#### Destroying infrastructure (use with care)

1. Configure Terraform to use Remote State using the following command:
